This was my attempt at a Frontend Mentor challenge of intermediate level ( 3 / 5 on their scale ). I was given a couple of different design JPG files on what it should look like in mobile and desktop view. There were a few items included in a style guide for font family and colors. Other then being given a few data pieces and pictures of design, the project was started from scratch.
